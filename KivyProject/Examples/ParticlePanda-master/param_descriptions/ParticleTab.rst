All Variation Sliders alter each individual particle's property by a random amount between 0 and the variation value. 

Max Particles
  This controls the total number of particles present inside the effect. It is recommended to use as few particles as necessary to achieve the desired visual effect

Life Span
  The amount of time each particle exists in seconds.

Start Size
  Size in pixels at which the particle begins.

End Size
  Size in pixels at which the particle ends.

Emit angle
  The angle, in degrees, at which the particles are emitted from the center (e.g. 0 points directly to the right and 90 points straight up)

Start Rotation
  Beginning rotation of particle

End Rotation
  End Rotation of the particle
