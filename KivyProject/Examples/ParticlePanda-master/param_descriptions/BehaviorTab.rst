Gravity Emitter
---------------------

Emitter X Variance
  Number of pixels in either X direction of the emitter location that particles will spread out over.

Emitter Y Variance
  Number of pixels in either Y direction of the emitter location that particles will spread out over.

Gravity X
  The magnitude of X gravity (measured in pixels per second)

Gravity Y
  The magnitude of Y gravity (measured in pixels per second)

Speed
  How fast the particles move (measured in pixels per second)

Radial Acceleration
  The particle's acceleration  _outward_ from the center

Tangential Acceleration
  The particle's acceleration in a direction perpendicular to that in *Radial Acceleration* (e.g. the direction that a bucket will fly off in if you've been swinging it around your head and you let go.)

Radial Emitter
--------------------

Max Radius
  The outer radius of the radial emitter; particles start here.

Min Radius
  The inner radius of the radial emitter; particles finish here. Set to zero if you want the particles to meet in the middle.

Rotate Per Second
  The number of degrees each particle rotates every second. Positive values will cause the particles to rotate counter-clockwise, negative values will cause the particles to rotate clockwise.
