Start Color
  The RGBA color at which the particle begins. You can choose among any of the colors in the color wheel by tapping on a color. To access darker colors, flick the wheel inward. Use the slider to the left of the color wheel for coarse control over the alpha (transparency) value. For finer control over the R, G, B, and A components of a color, tap on the relevant label above the color wheel. 

Start Color Variation
  Varies each particle start color by a random amount between 0 and the selected value. For the color's Red, Green, and Blue components this is measured on the standard 0-255 color scale; for alpha (transparency) it is measured from 0-100%.

End Color
  The RGBA color at which the particle ends. Uses the same interface as for Start Color.

End Color Variation
  Varies each particle end color by a random amount between 0 and the selected value. Uses the same interface as for Start Color.
