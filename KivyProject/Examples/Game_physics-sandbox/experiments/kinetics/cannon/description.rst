Cannon experiment
=================

Description
-----------

This experiment shows common class of problems in physics.

There are two forces, that apply to the cannonball: Gravity and Wind force.
Without Wind force the ball is moving along X-axis with constant speed, but when we apply
the force from wind, we have to solve much more complex problem with aiming.

You can only change start velocity at start.
Try to change some parameters and get longest air time. Reset the system to try again.
