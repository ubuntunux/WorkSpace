Note:
Some code is refurbished from my earlier project PyTowerDefense: http://sourceforge.net/projects/pytowerdefense/
All reused code is clearly marked as such.

How to add more levels:
Copy the contents of one of the level files. Paste it into a new file named X.txt, where X is the current highest level + 1. Change the blocks however you like. 0 means there's no block at that position, otherwise the value 1-9 or X (for ten) stands for how many hits the block can take before disappearing.

Comment:
Sadly, I didn't have any time to work on this game in August (the other course I'm taking took all time) so it lacks some features and polish I would have liked.
For example, some boilerplate code for adding powerups is implemented but there are no powerups.
